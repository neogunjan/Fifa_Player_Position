# Fifa_Player_Position
### This project involves visualization and classification of soccer players

One of the main factors that increases a team’s chance at winning games is player selection, more specifically, having the players with the right physical and technical attributes in the right places. In a team, there are eleven players that have their own unique positions on the field. Excluding the goal keeping position, there are ten outfield players that can be grouped by their commonalities. In this project the four most important positions in soccer will be analyzed. These positions include Center Backs (CB), Full Backs (FB), Center Midfielders (CM) and Strikers (ST). Exploration will be done via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to visualize our data in detail. Then, a classification approach is introduced to classify a player’s position based on their given features using a trained Random Forest (RF) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The data used in the visualization, training and testing of the aforementioned models was obtained from kaggle.com. The full project is decribed in detail in the Wiki section.

Project implemented in R and R-studio
